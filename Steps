Step 2: Create a REST API in API Gateway
Go to API Gateway ‚Üí Create API

Choose HTTP API

Integration type: HTTP

URL: Public IP or DNS of your EC2 instance (e.g., http://ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute.amazonaws.com)

Route: / ‚Üí Method: ANY

Deployment stage: prod

curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
‚úÖ Part 2: Configure AWS Global Accelerator for Global Performance

Step 3: Create a Web Server Behind ALB (Oregon)
Launch an EC2 instance in us-west-2 (Oregon) with same Apache setup as above.

Create a Target Group for the instance (protocol: HTTP, port 80).

Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):

Attach it to the target group.

Listener: HTTP on port 80 ‚Üí forward to target group.

Add security group rules to allow HTTP traffic.

Step 4: Configure Global Accelerator
Go to Global Accelerator ‚Üí Create Accelerator

Name: WebAppAccelerator

Add two endpoints:

Endpoint 1: EC2 instance in N. Virginia

Endpoint 2: ALB in Oregon

Weight both endpoints equally or based on region preference.

Health checks: Enabled

The accelerator provides a static IP or DNS, which automatically routes to the healthiest/nearest endpoint.

‚úÖ Part 3: Deliver Content with Amazon CloudFront
Step 5: Create a CloudFront Distribution
Go to CloudFront ‚Üí Create Distribution

Origin domain: Use either:

EC2 Public DNS (N. Virginia)

ALB DNS name (Oregon)

Origin Protocol Policy: HTTP Only

Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

Enable caching, configure TTLs as needed

Web Distribution settings: allow GET and HEAD methods

After creation, note the CloudFront URL (e.g., d123.cloudfront.net)

Test it:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl https://d123.cloudfront.net
üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
Use IAM roles and least privilege for EC2 and API Gateway access.

Use WAF with CloudFront for application-layer security (optional but recommended).

Enable HTTPS listeners on ALB with SSL/TLS certificates (from ACM).

Ensure all logs (CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway) are enabled and sent to CloudWatch/S3 for analysis.


Global Accelerator routes traffic to nearest healthy endpoint (EC2 or ALB).

CloudFront caches and speeds up content delivery.

API Gateway proxies to the backend via HTTP for RESTful services.
